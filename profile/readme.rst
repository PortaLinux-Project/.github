**********************************
Welcome to the PortaLinux Project!
**********************************

The PortaLinux Project is a collection of libraries and scripts to make your own embedded Linux OS with a GUI or TUI, all while
being under 2MB in size and requiring less than 64MB of RAM. The Project's core consists of the PortaLinux Runtime (``pl-rt``),
the PortaLinux Toolkit (``pltk``), the PortaLinux Init System (``pl-srv``), the PortaLinux Terminal Library (``pltermlib``) and, most
importantly, PortaLinux itself.
