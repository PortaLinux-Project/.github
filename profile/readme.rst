**********************************
Welcome to the PortaLinux Project!
**********************************

The PortaLinux Project is a collection of libraries and scripts to make your own embedded Linux OS with a GUI or TUI, all while
being under 2MB in size and requiring less than 64MB of RAM. The Project's core consists of the PortaLinux Runtime (`pl-rt`),
the PortaLinux Toolkit (`pltk`), the PortaLinux Init System (`pl-srv`), the PortaLinux Terminal Library (`pltermlib`) and, most
importantly, PortaLinux itself.

Contributions
#############

Currently, none of the projects are open to contributions. However, PortaLinux (`portalinux` repo) might open to contributions
after release version 0.11
